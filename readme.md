# Music Genre Classification and Clustering


 *This is team project with [Özge Çokça](https://github.com/ozgecokca/).* 


 Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms have been applied to categorize music genres.

## Dataset
> GTZAN Music Genre Dataset, of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. There are 10 genres represented, each containing 100 tracks.

* **librosa** library was used for feature extraction in the processing .

## Techniques
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- SVM
- K-means
- Hieararchial clustering
